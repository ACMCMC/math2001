The mechanics of proof
======================

This is a set of lecture notes dealing with how to write careful, rigorous mathematical proofs.
The lecture notes are paired with code in the computer formalization language
`Lean <https://leanprover-community.github.io/>`_. Head over to the associated GitHub repository,
https://github.com/hrmacbeth/math2001, to download this code to your own computer or to open it in
the cloud on Gitpod.

These lecture notes are aimed at the early university level and have been written for the course
Math 2001, at Fordham University.

For now (Fall 2022), these lecture notes are work in progress, and only a few chapters have been
written.  Testing and feedback is welcome, but please be warned that some sections contain problems
without yet the explanatory paragraphs which would be needed to solve them.
