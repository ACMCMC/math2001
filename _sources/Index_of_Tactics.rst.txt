Index of Lean tactics
=====================

Italicized tactics are specific to this course, so you will not be able to get help with them by
googling/consulting internet forums/etc.  Reread the indicated part of the lecture notes or ask
your instructor!

.. rubric:: *addarith* (:ref:`first use <shortcut>`)

Attempts to solve an equality or inequality by moving terms from the left-hand side to the
right-hand side, or vice versa.

.. rubric:: apply (:ref:`first use <lemmas>`)

Invokes a specified lemma to modify the goal.

.. rubric:: cases (:ref:`first use <or>`)

Takes apart a hypothesis of the form "or" (:math:`\lor`), "and" (:math:`\land`) or "there exists"
(:math:`\exists`).

.. rubric:: left (:ref:`first use <or>`)

Selects the left alternative of an "or" goal (:math:`\lor`).

.. rubric:: have (:ref:`first use <tactic_mode>`)

Sets up an intermediate goal, so that, after that's proved, you have that fact available as an
extra hypothesis.

.. rubric:: *ineq_tac* (:ref:`first use <proving_inequalities>`)

A "substitution-like" tactic for inequalities: looks for the left-hand side of a specified
inequality fact in the goal, and replaces it with the right-hand side of that fact, if that
replacement is "obviously" a valid inequality deduction.

.. rubric:: *mod_cases* (:ref:`first use <using_modular>`)

Introduces cases for a variable according to its residue modulo a specified number.

.. rubric:: *mod_rw* (:ref:`first use <using_modular>`)

A "substitution-like" tactic for congruences: looks for the left-hand side of a specified
modular arithmetic fact in the goal, and replaces it with the right-hand side of that fact, if that
replacement is "obviously" a valid modular arithmetic deduction.

.. rubric:: norm_num

Proves numeric facts, like :math:`3\cdot 12 < 13 + 25`.

.. rubric:: right (:ref:`first use <or>`)

Selects the right alternative of an "or" goal (:math:`\lor`).

.. rubric:: ring (:ref:`first use <proving_equalities_in_lean>`)

Solves algebraic equality goals such as :math:`(x + y) ^ 2 = x ^ 2 + 2xy + y ^ 2`, when the proof
is effectively "expand out both sides and rearrange".

.. rubric:: rw (:ref:`first use <proving_equalities_in_lean>`)

Substitution: looks for the left-hand side of a specified equality fact in the goal, and replaces it with
the right-hand side of that fact.
