The mechanics of proof
======================

This is a set of lecture notes dealing with how to write careful, rigorous mathematical proofs.
The lecture notes are paired with code in the computer formalization language
`Lean <https://leanprover.github.io/about/>`_. Head over to the associated GitHub repository,
https://github.com/hrmacbeth/math2001, to download this code to your own computer or to open it in
the cloud on Gitpod.

These lecture notes are aimed at the early university level and have been written for the course
Math 2001, at Fordham University.

The course is currently (Spring 2023) in progress, and new material is being added regularly.  Check
back often for updates!

Please note that later sections consist of material which has not been
reached yet in lectures: these sections are not yet in their final form, and might e.g. contain
problems without yet the explanatory paragraphs which would be needed to solve them.
